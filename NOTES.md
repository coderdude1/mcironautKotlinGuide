# Notes
1. The Application class looks different when using the micronaut builder (in intellij) vs the example code in the quickstart
2. Enable annotation processing allows using the intellij builder vs gradle (gradle settings)
3. I **Think* I can use a mono with a publisher to hit a non-reactive endpoint
4. JSON serialization.  I imported some jackson stuff, not sure if it is needed https://micronaut.io/2022/01/31/micronaut-serialization/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Micronaut%20co%2Dfounder%2C,other%20formats%20without%20using%20reflection.
